## Getting started
- Download the [latest build](https://github.com/aquacluck/totk-lotuskit/releases) for your game version. This is replaced with every commit, so you might want to hang on to the zip in case I break it in the future!
- Extract the zip and edit the configs in the `romfs` folder. Install the mod by copying the `romfs` and `exefs` folders into your switch sd's `/atmosphere/contents/0100f2c0115b6000/` folder.
- Run the game.
- Depending on your settings in `romfs/totk_lotuskit/config.json`, the game may hang at bootup and wait for your frontend, or remain offline (still logging to the debug console in emulators), or ~~TODO you may connect later~~.
- If running on console: Be sure the server bindIP config matches the network you want to serve, i.e. enter the switch's own wifi address to serve wifi clients, or set enter the switch's own ethernet address to listen there. Don't leave this as localhost, here localhost means binding to loopback on the console and ignoring all your requests from the outside.
- Run `frontend/run.py` (you'll need a python installation) and open the web frontend at [http://127.0.0.1:7073](http://127.0.0.1:7073)
- Connect to an emulator with localhost (default), or enter your switch console ip+port in the bottom right to connect to the mod.

## Building the mod from source
- Manual preprocessing for certain work/changes:
    - Many headers are mirrored+patched from https://github.com/dt-12345/totk , see `dt_totk/CLOBBER_mirror.sh` to update or further patch them. tldr it rewrites the folder with upstream + local patches, which we commit into this repo.
    - angelscript source is similarly mirrored, and often receives nice new features
    - `syms/build.py` is a symbol map+metadata build pipeline, keep this in sync! A header file holding `sym::` prefixed symbols and a linker script symbol table for each game version will be generated.
- Run `make` in a suitable build environment (such as [devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started) or a [docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/pixelkiri/devkitpro-alpine-switch/)) with cmake installed
- Mod `exefs` files are at `build/main.npdm` and `build/subsdk9`, copy `romfs` configs from the repo

## Repo overview
- `.github` automatically builds and [releases](https://github.com/aquacluck/totk-lotuskit/releases) each commit. You could reproduce the build with this or set it up in your own repo clone.
- `angelscript` contains a patched mirror of the lib
- `dt_totk` contains many patched C++ headers for libs used in the game
- `frontend` is an optional web frontend copied into every release zip. A quickie python http server is provided, and you can serve this however you like, but non-http `file://` access will not work!
- `romfs` is a skeleton/template for files which should be installed with the mod, copied into every release zip
- `src/program` is the C++ mod source
- `syms` is a symbol map+metadata build system, see above for details. This isn't run during `make`, just done manually for now.
